@section Create Distribution

The following command will create a @value{PROJECT.name} source distribution. It is during this step that shipped documentation is generated.

@example
@COMMAND.dist{}
@end example

This step in the build process introduces some significant requirements to the host system. While most of the following utilities are generally available, the GNU texinfo and Doxygen are not as ubiquitous:

@itemize
@item GNU texinfo 4.8 or higher (lower versions should work)
@item Doxygen 1.5.7 or higher (lower versions should work)
@item GNU tar 1.15.1 or higher (lower versions should work)
@item GNU gzip 1.3.10 or higher (lower versions should work)
@item bzip2 1.0.4 or higher (lower versions should work)
@item Info-ZIP zip 2.32 or higher (lower versions should work)
@end itemize
